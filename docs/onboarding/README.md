# Onboarding Documentation

Welcome to the AI-driven test automation agent project!

This agent works for **test automation** but can be used for **general workflow automation**. This documentation will guide you from understanding the problem space to contributing to the project.

## Reading Order

Read the docs in sequence for the best onboarding experience:

1. **[00-why-this-project.md](00-why-this-project.md)**  
   Why we're building this AI testing agent and what problems it solves.

2. **[01-testing-qa-basics.md](01-testing-qa-basics.md)**  
   Quick context on test types, E2E challenges, and important terminology.

3. **[02-automation-tools-explained.md](02-automation-tools-explained.md)**  
   Introduction to Selenium, Appium, and Playwright — the tools we build on.

4. **[03-traditional-automation-with-code.md](03-traditional-automation-with-code.md)**  
   How traditional automation works: locators, raw code examples, and the 8 core problems.

5. **[04-robot-framework-better-but-limited.md](04-robot-framework-better-but-limited.md)**  
   What Robot Framework is, how it improves on raw code, but why problems remain at scale.

6. **[05-why-agentic-ai-for-automation.md](05-why-agentic-ai-for-automation.md)**  
   How our AI agent adds intelligence: self-healing, visual validation, semantic understanding.

7. **[06-project-glossary.md](06-project-glossary.md)**  
   Key terms and concepts used throughout the project.

## Quick Navigation

### For newcomers to automation
Start with docs 00-04 to understand the automation landscape, traditional approaches, and their challenges.

### For experienced QA engineers or automation developers
You can skim docs 01-02 and focus on docs 03-05 to see traditional problems and how AI solves them.

## Contributing to Docs

Found something unclear or missing? Please:
1. Open an issue describing what's confusing
2. Or submit a PR with improvements

Keep docs:
- Short and focused (one concept per doc)
- Example-driven (show, don't just tell)
- Beginner-friendly (assume minimal context)

## Next Steps

After completing the onboarding:
1. Check the `2-dev-setup/` folder for installation and configuration guides
2. Explore the codebase
3. Start contributing or experimenting with the agent

Welcome aboard!
